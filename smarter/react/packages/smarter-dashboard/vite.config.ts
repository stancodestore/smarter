/**
 * Vite Configuration for the React App
 *
 * This configuration file sets up the Vite build and development environment for the
 * React application, which is integrated into a Django project. It handles:
 *
 * - Building React assets with Vite and outputting them to the Django static directory for collectstatic.
 * - Injecting custom build metadata (version, build time, environment) into the manifest for Django use.
 * - Optionally deploying built assets to S3 and invalidating CloudFront for production CDN usage.
 * - Proxying API and static asset requests to the Django development server during local development.
 * - Optimizing caching by bundling xterm.js separately from the main app code.
 * - Removing console.debug statements from production builds to avoid leaking sensitive info.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - For development, run the Vite dev server. Static and API requests are proxied to Django.
 * - For production, build assets with Vite. Output is placed in Django's static directory and can be deployed to S3/CDN.
 *
 * Integration:
 * - The manifest.json is used by Django templatetags to resolve hashed asset filenames for cache busting.
 * - The configuration supports both local and CDN-based static file serving.
 *
 * See README.md for more details on development and deployment workflows.

 * Key features:
 * - Uses custom plugins for manifest metadata and optional CDN deployment
 * - Removes console.debug in production builds
 * - Outputs assets to Django's static directory for collectstatic
 * - Proxies API and static requests to Django during development
