Executes the 'get' command for Smarter resources using a YAML manifest in the smarter.sh/v1 format.

This is the API endpoint for the 'get' command in the Smarter command-line interface (CLI). The 'get' command is a Smarter Brokered and Journaled operation that is used with all Smarter resources. Get criteria is passed as url query parameters.

The client making the HTTP request to this endpoint is expected to be the Smarter CLI, which is written in Golang and available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The response from this endpoint is a JSON object.

This is a brokered operation, so the actual work is delegated to the appropriate broker based on the resource kind specified in the manifest. See smarter.apps.api.v1.cli.brokers.Brokers
