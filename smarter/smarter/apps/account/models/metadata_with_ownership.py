Account MetaDataWithOwnership Model
===================================

This module provides an abstract Django ORM base model and supporting classes for
resource ownership and permission management within the Smarter platform. It extends
the core metadata model to include ownership by user profiles and accounts, and
provides permission-aware querysets and managers for filtering resources based on
user access rights.

Classes
-------

- MetaDataWithOwnershipModel
    Abstract base model that adds ownership fields and logic to metadata models.
- MetaDataWithOwnershipModelManager
    Custom manager that returns permission-aware querysets.
- SmarterQuerySetWithPermissions
    QuerySet subclass with methods for filtering by read and ownership permissions.

Features
--------

- Ownership enforcement via foreign key to UserProfile.
- Permission-based filtering for read and management (ownership) access.
- Caching for optimized retrieval of model instances.
- Uniqueness constraints on resource name and owner.
- Integration with Smarter's custom logging and exception handling.

Usage
-----

This module is intended to be subclassed by concrete models that require
ownership and permission logic. Do not instantiate MetaDataWithOwnershipModel directly.
