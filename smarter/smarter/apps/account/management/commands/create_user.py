        """
        Create a new user for the specified account. If the user already exists,
        update the user's information. The basic workflow is as follows:

          1. Get the account based on the provided account number. If the account does
              not exist, log a failure and return False.
          2. Attempt to get or create the user based on the provided username. If there
              is an error during user creation, log a failure and return False.
          3. If the user already exists, log a notice that the existing user will be
              updated. Set the user's staff status based on the is_admin flag. Validate
              the provided email address and if it is invalid, log a failure and return
              False. Update the user's email, first name, last name, and active status.
              If a password is provided, set the user's password to the provided
              password. If no password is provided and the user was created, generate a
              random password, set it for the user, and log the generated password.
              Attempt to save the user and if there is an error during saving, log a
              failure and return False. Log a success message that the user has been
              created or updated.
          4. If the user was created and the Waffle switch
              ENABLE_NEW_USER_PASSWORD_EMAIL is active, attempt to send an email to the
              user with their account credentials. If there is an error during email
              sending, log a failure but do not return False since the user account has
              been created successfully.
          5. Attempt to get or create a UserProfile for the user and account. If there
              is an error during this process, log a failure and return False. If the
              UserProfile was created, log a success message.
          6. Attempt to get an AccountContact for the account and email. If it exists,
              update the first name and last name and save it. If it does not exist,
              create a new AccountContact. If there is an error during this process,
              log a failure and return False.
          7. If all steps are successful, log a success message that the create_user
              command completed successfully and return True.
