class LLMClientRequests(TimestampedModel):
    """
    Stores the request history for a LLMClient instance within the Smarter platform.

    This model is designed to record and manage all incoming requests made to an llm_client, providing a persistent audit trail
    of interactions for analysis, debugging, and reporting. Each record in this model captures the details of a single request,
    including the associated llm_client, the request payload, session information, and aggregation status.

    **Purpose and Usage**

    The LLMClientRequests model enables comprehensive tracking of llm_client usage and user interactions. By storing each request,
    the platform can support features such as:

    - Request analytics and reporting for llm_client performance and user engagement.
    - Debugging and trouble shooting of llm_client behavior by reviewing historical requests.
    - Session management, allowing grouping and correlation of requests within a user session.
    - Aggregation of requests for batch processing or summarization.

    **Model Relationships**

    - Each LLMClientRequests entry is linked to one :class:`LLMClient` instance, establishing a direct association between the request and the llm_client that handled it.

    **Notes**

    - This model is intended for internal use to support auditing, analytics, and operational monitoring of llm_client activity.
    - The request data is stored in JSON format to accommodate flexible and extensible payload structures.
    - Aggregation support allows for efficient handling of bulk or grouped requests, which may be relevant for advanced llm_client workflows.

    **Example Usage**

    .. code-block:: python

        # Record a new request for an llm_client
        LLMClientRequests.objects.create(
            llm_client=my_llm_client,
            request={"message": "Hello, llm_client!"},
            session_key="abc123",
            is_aggregation=False,
        )

        # Retrieve all requests for a specific llm_client
        requests = LLMClientRequests.objects.filter(llm_client=my_llm_client)
