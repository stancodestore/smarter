class LLMClientCustomDomain(TimestampedModel):
    """
    Represents a DNS host record for a customer account's LLMClient, linked to an AWS Hosted Zone.

    This model is used to manage custom domains for llm_clients within the Smarter platform. Each instance
    of this model corresponds to a DNS host (subdomain) that is associated with a specific customer
    account and is managed through AWS Route 53 Hosted Zones.

    The primary purpose of this model is to enable customers to use their own branded domains for
    llm_client endpoints, rather than relying solely on default platform-provided domains. This allows
    for improved branding, trust, and integration with customer infrastructure.

    **Key Features**

    - Associates a custom domain with a customer :class:`Account`.
    - Stores the AWS Hosted Zone ID for DNS management and automation.
    - Tracks the verification status of the domain, indicating whether DNS records have been correctly
      configured and validated.
    - Supports caching of verified domains for efficient lookup and validation across the platform.

    **Usage Scenarios**

    - When a customer wishes to deploy an llm_client at a custom subdomain (e.g., ``llm_client.example.com``),
      an instance of this model is created to represent and manage that domain.
    - The platform uses the AWS Hosted Zone ID to automate DNS record creation and validation as part
      of the llm_client deployment workflow.
    - The ``is_verified`` field is updated as part of the DNS verification process, ensuring that only
      properly configured domains are used for llm_client endpoints.

    **Integration**

    - This model is referenced by other llm_client-related models, such as :class:`LLMClient` and
      :class:`LLMClientCustomDomainDNS`, to provide a complete mapping between llm_clients, their domains,
      and DNS records.
    - The platform uses this model to enforce domain uniqueness and to prevent conflicts between
      customer accounts.

    **Notes**

    - The domain name must be a valid DNS hostname and is validated upon saving.
    - Caching is used to optimize the retrieval of verified domains, reducing database load and
      improving performance for domain-related checks.
    - This model is intended for internal use within the Smarter platform and is not exposed directly
      to end users.
