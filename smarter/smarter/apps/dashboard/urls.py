This module is the top-level URL router for the ``smarter.apps.dashboard``
application. It includes the URL configurations from each dashboard
sub-application and mounts them at the paths listed below.

Attributes:
    app_name (str): The Django application namespace, taken from
        :data:`smarter.apps.dashboard.const.namespace`.

Example:
    Include these URLs from the project-level URL configuration::

        from django.urls import include, path

        urlpatterns = [
            path("dashboard/", include("smarter.apps.dashboard.urls")),
        ]
