"""
API view for the Dashboard "Service Health" React component.

This module provides a lightweight JSON endpoint consumed by the Service Health
React widget on the main dashboard page. It returns version and environment
metadata for the running Smarter platform so that operators can quickly verify
which versions of core dependencies are active.

Classes:
    ServiceHealthView: Authenticated POST endpoint that returns platform
        version and environment metadata as a JSON response.

Example:
    Wire up the view in your URL configuration::

        from smarter.apps.dashboard.views.views.api.service_health import ServiceHealthView

        urlpatterns = [
            path("service-health/", ServiceHealthView.as_view(), name="service_health"),
        ]

    Authenticated JSON API view that reports platform version and environment metadata.

    Extends :class:`~smarter.lib.django.views.SmarterAuthenticatedWebView` to

    On a ``POST`` request the view reads version strings and environment
    information from :data:`~smarter.common.conf.smarter_settings` and returns
    them as a flat JSON object with an HTTP 200 status.
