    AWS S3 helper class.
    Provides a high-level interface for managing Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) resources.

    This helper class abstracts common operations related to AWS S3, such as retrieving and verifying S3 buckets,
    and managing connections to the S3 service. It simplifies interactions with the AWS S3 API by encapsulating
    client initialization and error handling, making it easier to integrate S3 management into automation workflows
    or larger AWS orchestration systems.

    The class is designed to work with application configuration settings and ensures that AWS sessions are properly
    initialized before performing any operations. It supports robust and maintainable code by providing logging and
    exception handling for operations involving S3 resources, such as bucket discovery and validation, within AWS
    environments.
