    Converts a series of args into a URL path. This is a wrapper around
    Django's built-in `reverse` function, but it is designed to to fit
    the exact pattern used across the Smarter codebase, which is to pass
    in a series of namespace arguments followed by a view name.

    For example, if you have a view named "my_view" that is in the "my_app"
    namespace, you would call this function like this:

    ```python
    reverse("my_app:my_view")
    ```

    This function will then split the argument into its components and pass
    them to Django's `reverse` function in the correct format.

    param args: A series of strings representing namespaces and the view name.
    param kwargs: Any keyword arguments to pass to Django's `reverse` function. If any keyword arguments are provided, this function will assume that the caller is not using the expected pattern and will pass all arguments directly to Django's `reverse` function without modification.
    return: The URL path corresponding to the given view name and namespaces.
