# Smarter lib

This folder contains extensions to third party code used in the project.
Rather than subclass these packages, we prefer to import the original
package here, and then create our additional/modified code such that it
is importable via `smarter.lib.`. For example, we've made enhancements
to Python's `json` library, which is imported across the project as follows:

```python
from smarter.lib import json
from smarter.lib import logging
```
