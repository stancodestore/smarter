# This Dockerfile is used to build the following:
# - Smarter application.
# - Smarter Celery worker.
# - Smarter Celery beat.
#
# This image is used for all environments (local, alpha, beta, next and production).
# - It is published to DockerHub as mcdaniel0073/smarter:latest
#   https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mcdaniel0073/smarter/general
# - It is also the basis of the Helm chart used to deploy Smarter to production Kubernetes clusters.

#
# 3.13-slim-trixie is an official Docker image tag for Python 3.13 based on
# Debian "Trixie" (the codename for Debian 13).
# The "slim" variant is a minimal image that excludes unnecessary files and packages,
# making it smaller and faster to download and build.
# It is commonly used for production deployments where a lightweight Python environment is preferred.
# This is important because the Smarter container image build exceeds 2.4 GB,
# even when using the slim image as a base.

############################ build remote react ###############################
# The Smarter web console UI includes several React components, such as the
# main dashboard, prompt (LLMClients) list, terminal emulator, and prompt passthrough.
# Vite pushes builds of these React components to a CDN which is used as a general
# purpose distribution mechanism for the latest production-ready builds of these components.
#
# The downloaded assets are placed in smarter/smarter/static/react/,
# from which Django collects its static files. This directory is ignored by git
# because it contains build assets rather than source code, so, these assets
# are always fetched as part of the Docker build process rather than being
# committed to the repository.
#
# Developers: Note that Vite also saves locally to this same directory for local development.
# Thus, you can still use the Makefile command `make collectstatic`
# to build React components locally if needed, but the default and recommended workflow
# is to rely on the CDN downloads for all environments.
