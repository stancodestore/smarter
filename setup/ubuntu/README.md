# Smarter Development Environment for Debian/Ubuntu

The Smarter developer environment is Docker based, which helps to abstract away
many of the platform's run-time dependencies. However, there are still quite a
few things you'll need to install in order to get your Smarter developer
environment completely up and running.

## Local System Dependencies

Use [setup.sh](./setup.sh) to automate installation where possible. Use the
example [.zshrc](./.zshrc.example) as a reference for adding the necessary PATHs
and compiler and linker flags.

### Python Virtual Environment Dependencies

These low-level packages are only required for creating the local Python virtual
environment, which itself is only used for syntax and type checking inside of
VS Code. These are not actually used at run-time.
