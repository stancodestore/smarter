# Smarter API Command-line Interface

The Smarter cli is a standalone application written in Go lang that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. It is separately managed in [github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-cli](https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-cli). It is a lightweight command-line UI for interacting with the [Smarter API](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/cli/).

## Commands

The cli implements a set of verbs for working with Smarter resources

- [apply](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/cli/views/apply.py): executes services as necessary in order to migrate a Smarter resource from its present state to that which is described in the provided manifest.
- [delete](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/cli/views/delete.py): permanently, unrecoverably destroys a Smarter resource.
- [deploy](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/cli/views/delete.py): manages the deploy state of a deployable Smarter resource (Plugin and ChatBot).
- [describe](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/cli/views/describe.py): returns a report in yaml or json format that is a superset of a manifest describing the present state of a Smarter resource.
- [logs](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/cli/views/describe.py): returns log data in standard console log format for a Smarter resource
- [status](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/cli/views/status.py): returns a report in yaml or json format that provides real-time information on the state of the Smarter platform.

## Manifest Spec

The cli is designed to work with a manifest utf-8 text document, in yaml or json format, inspired by Kubernetes' kubectl, itself modeled on the [OpenAPI Specification v3.x](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html). The actual implementation of this specification is located [here](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/cli/). The Smarter API can manage [escaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character) representations of characters outside of the utf-8 standard.

[Example manifest](../smarter/smarter/apps/plugin/data/sample-plugins/example-configuration.yaml)

### Broker Model

Manifest processing depends on a abstract broker service. Brokers are implemented inside of Django Views and are responsible for mapping the verb of an http request -- get, post, patch, put, delete -- to the Python class containing the necessary services for the manifest `kind`. Brokers are responsible for the following:

- Defining a manifest file structure using a collection of Python enumerated data types along with basic [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/) features.
- Reading and parsing a manifest document in yaml or json format
- Validating manifests, using [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/) models that enforce format, syntax, and data and business rule validations.
- Instantiating the correct Python class for the manifest
- Implementing the services that back http requests: get, post, patch, put, delete

A brokered entity consists of the following:

- [Pydantic model](../smarter/smarter/apps/account/manifest/models/secret/). This is a Pydantic model that describes the Manifest yaml document. Smarter manifests closely resemble Kubernetes manifests.
- [Broker](../smarter/smarter/apps/account/manifest/brokers/secret.py). Brokers marshal requests to the correct Broker class and method.
- [Transformer](../smarter/smarter/apps/account/manifest/transformers/secret.py). Transformers map data to/from a Smarter manifest and a Django object relational model (ORM).
- [Docs url endpoints](../smarter/smarter/apps/docs/urls.py). Examples: https://platform.smarter.sh/docs/manifest/secret/ and https://platform.smarter.sh/docs/json-schema/secret/
- [Kind registration](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v1/manifests/enum.py)
- [Broker registration](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v1/cli/brokers.py). The Broker class implements an enumeration of all resource `Kinds`.
- [Json Schema docs view](../smarter/smarter/apps/docs/views/json_schema.py). Json schemas describe the Pydantic data model for the brokered resource. These are used for data-driven apps and services, such as the VS Code extension for Smarter manifests
- [Manifest docs view](../smarter/smarter/apps/docs/views/manifest.py). All brokers implement an `example_manifest()` method which, intuitively, generates a valid example Smarter yaml manifest for the `Kind` of resource.

#### Code samples

- Abstract [broker](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/manifests/broker.py)
- Example implementation for Plugin [broker](../smarter/smarter/apps/plugin/api/v0/manifests/broker.py)

### Controller Model

In cases where there exist multiple variations of a manifest `kind`, we use a Controller pattern to route a Broker to the correct Python subclass.

- Abstract [controller](../smarter/smarter/apps/api/v0/cli/controller.py)
- Example implementation for Plugin [controller](../smarter/smarter/apps/plugin/controller.py) as an example.
