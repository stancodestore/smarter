SAM Broker Model
=================

The Smarter Broker Model for the command-line interface (CLI) establishes an abstract set of pattnerns
for implementing a static set of commands operated on Smarter yaml manifest files. These are operations
that are intended to be initiated by the Smarter CLI tool. See `github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-cli <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-cli>`__.

See :py:class:`smarter.apps.api.v1.cli.views.base.CliBaseApiView` for details on the base CLI view CliBaseApiView.

AI Resources that implement the Broker Model will subclass the AbstractBroker class (see class referencebelow).
