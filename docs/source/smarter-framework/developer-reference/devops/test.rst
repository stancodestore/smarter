Test
====

Smarter takes testing seriously. Pull requests must pass all tests before they can be merged. Moreover,
code coverage is monitored on pull requests to ensure that new code is adequately tested. While 100% coverage is not
patently unrealistic for this project, we strive to maintain high coverage across the codebase. In parts of the
codebase that we consider 'core', we aim for at least 90% coverage.

Try to the guidelines below to help ensure that your tests provide maximum value with minimum effort on your part.
We've invested heavily in unit test infrastructure by way of bases classes, mixins, and fixtures to make writing tests as easy
as possible.

Local Testing
-----------------

To run the test suite locally, use the following command from the project root:

.. code-block:: console

  docker exec smarter-app bash -c "python manage.py test smarter"

  # or, to run tests for a specific app
  docker exec smarter-app bash -c "python manage.py test smarter.apps.account"

  # or
  make test

Coverage Report
-----------------

To generate a code coverage report, use the following command from the project root:

.. code-block:: console

  docker exec smarter-app bash -c "coverage run manage.py test && coverage report -m && coverage html"

  # or
  make coverage

Conventions
-----------

unittest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Smarter uses the built-in :mod:`unittest <unittest>` framework for unit tests. All tests should be placed
in a ``tests`` subpackage within the app being tested. Test modules should be named with the ``test_*.py``
pattern. Test case classes should be named with the ``*TestCase`` suffix. Individual test methods should be named
with the ``test_*`` prefix.

Try to keep tests nearby the code they are testing to make it easier to find and maintain them and to minimize the
the number of individual test files any any given directory.

data files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test data files should be placed in a ``data`` subdirectory nearby the ``tests`` package of the app being tested.


SmarterTestBase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All unit tests should inherit from :class:`SmarterTestBase <smarter.lib.unittest.base_classes.SmarterTestBase>`,
or from a subclass thereof. This base class provides a number of useful features, including functions
for reading test data files in various formats in a read-only manner, generating unique identifiers and hash suffixes.

.. code-block:: python

  from smarter.lib.unittest.base_classes import SmarterTestBase


TestAccountMixin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mixin inherits from :class:`SmarterTestBase <smarter.lib.unittest.base_classes.SmarterTestBase>`
and provides additional supporting functionality for tests that involve user accounts, such as creating test users
and logging them in and setting up various roles and permissions. This class does a reasonably good job of
cleaning up after itself, deleting any test users it creates, regardless of whether tests passe or fail.

.. code-block:: python

  from smarter.apps.account.tests.mixins import TestAccountMixin
