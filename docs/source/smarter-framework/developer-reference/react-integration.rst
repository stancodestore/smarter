Django-React Integration
========================

Smarter integrates `React <https://react.dev/>`__ applications directly into Django's server-rendered
architecture rather than treating React as a separate single-page
application. This approach preserves Django's strengths in authentication,
session management, template rendering, routing, and deployment while
enabling modern, highly interactive user interfaces. The core design principle
is that React build artifacts are treated as ordinary Django static assets that
leverage Django's existing serving and management of authentication and session data.

React applications are compiled by `Vite.js <https://vite.dev/>`__ into versioned JavaScript and CSS
bundles and emitted directly into Django's static file hierarchy. At runtime,
Django discovers and loads these assets through a manifest-driven integration
layer that automatically resolves hashed filenames, shared chunks, vendor
bundles, and code-split dependencies.

As a result, Django remains responsible for request routing, authentication,
template rendering, runtime configuration, static asset management, and
deployment orchestration, while React remains focused exclusively on frontend
behavior and presentation logic. Frontend and backend development can
therefore proceed largely independently while still participating in a
unified deployment model.

Request Lifecycle
-----------------

The following sequence describes how a React application is rendered within
the Django runtime:

1. A user requests a Django URL.
2. Django routes the request to a view.
3. The view generates runtime configuration and template context.
4. A custom template tag loads and analyzes the React build's manifest.json file.
5. JavaScript and CSS dependencies are recursively discovered.
6. Django renders the template and injects the required asset references.
7. The browser downloads the React bundles.
8. React IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) mounts onto a designated DOM element.
9. React reads runtime configuration from HTML attributes.
10. React begins communicating with backend APIs.

This architecture creates a lightweight integration boundary between Django
and React without requiring hardcoded asset references, inline bootstrap
scripts, environment-specific templates, or additional initialization APIs.

The remainder of this guide follows a complete implementation example and
then examines each integration layer in detail, including manifest analysis,
template tags, Vite configuration, runtime context propagation, and
deployment considerations.

An Example: The Terminal Application Component
------------------------------------------------

Smarter's live view of server log activity is a great example, in that it is a highly
interactive React component that involves live streaming data, complex state management,
and tight integration with Django's authentication and server-side context management.
Functionality of this nature could only be implemented in a frontend framework like React.

.. image:: https://cdn.smarter.sh/docs/smarter-framework/react-integration/react-integration.001.png
  :alt: View, Template, and React Component Integration
  :width: 100%


Django Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Terminal Application begins with a standard Django request lifecycle.
A URL pattern routes incoming requests for the pattern `/dashboard/logs/` to the Django view class
:class:`TerminalEmulatorLogView`. The view is also responsible for generating
and providing the API endpoint that the React application will use to retrieve log data.
Rather than hardcoding endpoint URLs, the view uses Django's :func:`reverse()`
function and Django URL namespaces to generate the correct endpoint at runtime.
This ensures that routing remains centralized within Django, that it remains
future-proofed against code refactoring, and that it assists code contributors in
understanding how frontend and backend routing are connected without
duplicating URL definitions across templates and React components.

.. image:: https://cdn.smarter.sh/docs/smarter-framework/react-integration/react-integration.003.png
  :alt: View, Template, and React Component Integration
  :width: 100%

The view's primary responsibilities are straightforward:

* Select the template to render.
* Generate runtime configuration required by the frontend.
* Provide template context.

The template then renders the initial HTML response and provides a DOM
mounting point for the React application.

.. image:: https://cdn.smarter.sh/docs/smarter-framework/react-integration/react-integration.004.png
  :alt: View, Template, and React Component Integration
  :width: 100%

In addition to rendering the mounting element, the template performs two
important integration tasks. First, it serializes runtime configuration
generated by the view into custom HTML attributes attached to the mounting
element (see example below). These attributes become the transport mechanism through which Django
passes configuration data into React during application initialization.

.. code-block:: html

  <div
    id="smarter-terminal-emulator-root"
    smarter-api-path="/dashboard/logs/api/stream/"
    smarter-cookie-domain="alpha.platform.example.com"
    smarter-csrf-cookie-name="csrftoken"
    smarter-django-session-cookie-name="sessionid"
  >

.. note::

    In this integration scheme, React does not technically require session nor csrf data in order to function,
    since React is served by Django and therefore shares the same origin. However,
    we pass these values in the interest of future-proofing against the possibility
    of serving React from a different origin, which would require explicit handling of
    authentication and CSRF tokens in API requests.

Second, the template invokes a custom Django template tag that analyzes
the React build's manifest.json file and injects the required
<script> and <link> elements for the application's JavaScript
and CSS assets (see annotations in bright green below). This process is
explained in detail later in this article.

.. image:: https://cdn.smarter.sh/docs/smarter-framework/react-integration/react-integration.005.png
  :alt: View, Template, and React Component Integration
  :width: 100%

Once the page has loaded, React mounts onto the designated DOM element (see annotations in orange above) and,
reads the runtime configuration exposed through the custom HTML attributes,
and begins communicating with Django APIs. From React's perspective, the
integration boundary is intentionally simple. The component receives configuration
values and API endpoints as props and remains completely unaware of how assets
were built, how the manifest was analyzed, or how JavaScript and CSS bundles
were injected into the page.

.. note::

   The React application never references static asset filenames directly.
   Asset discovery is performed entirely by Django through manifest analysis.

This separation of responsibilities is central to the architecture.
React focuses exclusively on frontend behavior, state management, and user
interaction, while Django and the build pipeline handle routing, asset
discovery, deployment, and runtime integration.

React Build Manifest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The React build’s manifest.json file for the Terminal Application is generated by
`Vite.js <https://vite.dev/>`__ and serves as the authoritative source of
truth for all JavaScript and CSS assets produced during the build process.
The manifest is necessary because production asset filenames are generated
with content-based hashes for browser cache invalidation. As a result, the names of
the generated files cannot be known in advance and should never be hardcoded
into Django templates. Instead, Django analyzes the manifest at runtime to
determine which assets must be loaded for a given React application, including
JavaScript bundles, stylesheets, shared chunks, and third-party dependencies. The
exact contents of a manifest vary from application to application,
depending on the number of dependencies, vendor libraries, code-split
modules, and build optimizations included in the React project.

The following example shows the manifest generated for the Terminal
Application:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "_rolldown-runtime-B8sk0Y4v.js": {
      "file": "assets/rolldown-runtime-B8sk0Y4v.js",
      "name": "rolldown-runtime"
    },
    "_xterm-BVTBumqj.js": {
      "file": "assets/xterm-BVTBumqj.js",
      "name": "xterm",
      "imports": [
        "_rolldown-runtime-B8sk0Y4v.js"
      ],
      "css": [
        "assets/xterm-kHJ-D0s7.css"
      ]
    },
    "_xterm-kHJ-D0s7.css": {
      "file": "assets/xterm-kHJ-D0s7.css",
      "src": "_xterm-kHJ-D0s7.css"
    },
    "index.html": {
      "file": "assets/index-B1eOzN5c.js",
      "name": "index",
      "src": "index.html",
      "isEntry": true,
      "imports": [
        "_rolldown-runtime-B8sk0Y4v.js",
        "_xterm-BVTBumqj.js"
      ],
      "css": [
        "assets/index-58MXwt-L.css"
      ]
    }
  }

Within Smarter’s React build conventions, a single manifest entry is
designated as the application’s primary entry point and contains the
"isEntry": true property. This entry serves as the root of the dependency
graph. Rather than injecting only the entry-point asset into the template, Django
recursively traverses the manifest to discover all required dependencies.
This includes imported JavaScript chunks, shared runtime modules, vendor
bundles, and associated CSS assets. The resulting asset list represents the
complete set of files required to initialize the React application correctly.
This recursive dependency analysis is performed by custom Django template
tags (see above), allowing templates to remain completely independent of the manifest’s
internal structure and the dynamically generated asset filenames.

  :width: 100%


Vite Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few more points about `Vite.js <https://vite.dev/>`__ are merited.
Vite is responsible for compiling React applications, generating production
assets, optimizing bundles, and producing the ``manifest.json`` file that
Django uses for runtime asset discovery. Because the manifest is derived
entirely from the build process, its structure and contents are determined by
the Vite configuration. Within Smarter, Vite serves as the bridge between React development and
Django deployment. Rather than requiring React applications to understand
deployment environments, static asset locations, CDN hosting, or runtime
integration details, these concerns are centralized within the build
configuration itself.

To support Django integration, the Vite configuration addresses several
requirements:

- **Manifest Generation**
    Generates a ``manifest.json`` file that maps source entry points to
    versioned JavaScript, CSS, and dependency assets.
- **Development Proxying**
    Proxies API requests and selected static resources from the Vite
    development server to the Django development server, allowing React
    applications to run locally while interacting with a live Django backend.
- **Static Asset Integration**
    Emits production build artifacts directly into Django’s static file
    hierarchy so that React assets participate naturally in the
    ``collectstatic`` workflow.
- **Security Compatibility**
    Preserves compatibility with Django authentication, CSRF protection,
    session cookies, and same-origin security policies.
- **CDN Deployment**
    Optionally synchronizes production assets to AWS S3 and invalidates
    associated CloudFront caches.
- **Production Hardening**
    Removes console.debug() statements from production bundles to reduce
    unnecessary console output and prevent accidental disclosure of debugging
    information.
- **Caching Optimization**
    Separates large third-party dependencies such as xterm.js into
    dedicated bundles so that vendor assets can remain cached independently
    from application-specific code.
- **Developer Experience**
    Supports hot module replacement (HMR) and rapid incremental rebuilds
    while maintaining compatibility with Django’s runtime environment.

The following example illustrates the Vite configuration used by the Terminal
Application component.

.. code-block:: javascript

  const postBuildPlugin: PluginOption = {
    name: "post-build",

    closeBundle() {
      if (packageJson.config.cdnDeploy === true) {
        execSync(
          `aws s3 sync ../../../smarter/static/react/${packageName} ${packageJson.config.s3BucketPath} --acl public-read --delete`,
          { stdio: "inherit" },
        );
        execSync(
          `aws --no-cli-pager cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${packageJson.config.cloudfrontDistributionId} --paths '/react/${packageName}/*'`,
          { stdio: "inherit" },
        );
      }
    },
  };

  export default defineConfig(({ command }: ConfigEnv) => ({
    plugins: [
      react(),
      postBuildPlugin,
    ],
    // We use esbuild to remove console.debug statements in production builds
    // in order to avoid leaking potentially sensitive information in

    esbuild: {
      pure: ["console.debug"],

    // Builds are also saved into the Django static directory so that these
    // files can be included in the Django collectstatic process and served by

    // we need to be able to support serving these files both from the Vite

        },
        "/dashboard/": "http://localhost:9357",
        [`/static/react/${packageName}/`]: {
          target: "http://localhost:5173",
          changeOrigin: true,

        "/static": {
          target: "http://localhost:9357",
          changeOrigin: true,
        },
        "/workbench/": "http://localhost:9357",
      },
    },
  }));


Django Template Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Custom Django template tags <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/howto/custom-template-tags/>`__ provide the integration layer between Django
templates and React build artifacts. As described in the previous section,
the Terminal Application's React build process generates a ``manifest.json``
file that contains the complete dependency graph for a React application,
including JavaScript bundles, stylesheets, shared chunks, and vendor
dependencies. Django templates should not need to understand the structure
of this manifest or the details of dependency traversal. Instead, Smarter
encapsulates this logic within reusable template tags.

At render time, a template tag loads the appropriate ``manifest.json`` file,
identifies the application’s entry point, recursively discovers all required
dependencies, and returns the resulting JavaScript and CSS asset lists to the
template. The template can then render the appropriate ``<script>`` and
``<link>`` elements without any knowledge of how the assets were generated or
how the dependency graph is structured. This approach provides several advantages:

* Eliminates hardcoded asset filenames.
* Supports cache-safe hashed build artifacts.
* Automatically resolves code-split dependencies.
* Keeps manifest traversal logic out of templates.
* Allows React applications to participate naturally in Django’s rendering process.

The following example illustrates how the Terminal Application template
retrieves the CSS and JavaScript assets associated with its React build.

.. code-block:: jinja

  {% extends "dashboard/base.html" %}
  {% load static %}
  {% load react_terminal_emulator %}


.. code-block:: jinja

  {% block style_extra %}
    {{ block.super }}

    {% terminal_emulator_react_assets as assets %}
    {% for css_file in assets.css %}
      <link class="smarter" rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'react/@smarter/terminal-emulator/' %}{{ css_file }}">
    {% endfor %}
  {% endblock %}

.. code-block:: jinja

  {% block javascript_extra %}
    {{ block.super }}

    {% terminal_emulator_react_assets as assets %}
    {% for js_file in assets.js %}
      <script class="smarter" type="module" src="{% static 'react/@smarter/terminal-emulator/' %}{{ js_file }}"></script>
    {% endfor %}
  {% endblock %}

From the template’s perspective, the interaction is intentionally simple.
The template requests a collection of CSS and JavaScript assets and renders
them. The details of manifest loading, dependency traversal, asset ordering,
and filename resolution remain encapsulated within the template tag
implementation.

See :doc:`SmarterReactTemplateTagManager <lib/django/templatetags>`.

Django Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Django template for the Terminal Application serves as the final integration
point between Django and React. It is responsible for assembling the HTML
required to initialize the React application and making server-side configuration
available to the frontend runtime. Specifically, the template performs three functions:

1. Provide a DOM mounting point for the React application.
2. Inject the JavaScript and CSS assets required by the React build.
3. Transport runtime configuration generated by the Django view into React.

The JavaScript and CSS assets are generated by the custom template tags
described in the previous section. These tags analyze the React build's
``manifest.json`` file and produce the ``<script>`` and ``<link>`` elements
required to load the application and all of its dependencies.
The template also renders a DOM element that serves as the mounting point for
the React application. In addition to providing a location where React can
attach itself to the page, this element exposes runtime configuration values
generated by the Django view through custom HTML attributes.
Typical configuration values include:

* API endpoint URLs
* Session and CSRF cookie names
* Cookie domains
* Feature flags
* Environment-specific settings
* Other application configuration required at runtime

The following example illustrates the mounting element used by the Terminal
Application:

.. code-block:: html

  <div
    id="smarter-terminal-emulator-root"
    smarter-api-path="/dashboard/logs/api/stream/"
    smarter-cookie-domain="alpha.platform.example.com"
    smarter-csrf-cookie-name="csrftoken"
    smarter-django-session-cookie-name="sessionid"
  >

During initialization, React locates the mounting element, reads the
configuration values from its attributes, and converts them into component
props supplied to the application’s root component. This pattern creates a clean
separation between Django and React. Django remains responsible for generating
runtime configuration, while React remains focused on application behavior and
presentation. Neither side requires knowledge of the other’s internal
implementation details.

The template is also responsible for invoking the custom template tags
described in the previous section. These tags analyze the React build’s
``manifest.json`` file and generate the ``<script>`` and ``<link>`` elements
required to load the application’s JavaScript and CSS assets.

  :alt: View, Template, and React Component Integration
  :width: 100%


Build, Deployment, and CI/CD Considerations
---------------------------------------------

React applications are organized as a single npm workspace containing multiple
independent packages. Each package produces its own ``manifest.json`` file and
associated build assets, which are emitted directly into a dedicated location
within Django’s static file hierarchy such as:

.. code-block:: text

  static/react/@smarter/terminal-emulator/

.. image:: https://cdn.smarter.sh/docs/smarter-framework/react-integration/react-npm-workspace.png
  :alt: React npm Workspace Structure
  :width: 100%

This build layout reflects a fundamental architectural principle described
throughout this guide:

.. note::

  React build artifacts are treated as ordinary Django static assets.

  From Django’s perspective, compiled React bundles are no different from any
  other static resource such as CSS, images, or JavaScript files. Once generated,
  they participate in the standard Django static asset workflow, including
  collectstatic, static file serving, cache management, and CDN distribution.

  Because React assets are generated before Django is deployed, the frontend
  build process remains cleanly separated from the Django runtime. React
  applications can be developed, versioned, tested, and rebuilt independently
  while still integrating seamlessly into Django’s deployment pipeline.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Source Control Exclusion
    Compiled React build artifacts are intentionally
    excluded from the Git repository and are never committed to source control.
    Build outputs are considered ephemeral deployment artifacts and must therefore
    be regenerated as part of the build process.
* Build Prerequisites
    Because Django templates and template tags depend
    on the existence of ``manifest.json`` and its associated static assets, the
    React build process must execute successfully at least once before the Django
    application can correctly render React-integrated pages. Keep this in mind
    when for example, you are tinkering with versions in ``package.json``.
* CI/CD Pipeline Initialization
    GitHub Actions workflows begin with a clean
    repository checkout that does not contain compiled frontend assets. Accordingly,
    React build steps must run early in the workflow before Docker builds,
    collectstatic, integration tests, or deployment stages that depend on
    these assets.

    .. image:: https://cdn.smarter.sh/docs/smarter-framework/react-integration/gha-build-workflow-for-react.png
       :alt: View, Template, and React Component Integration
       :width: 100%

* Static File Synchronization
    During local development, developers should remain aware of the distinction
    between Vite’s live development server, Django’s static asset directories,
    and the Django staticfiles runtime directory. Stale build artifacts can
    occasionally lead to confusing runtime behavior if these environments become
    out of sync.
* Container Build Dependencies
    Docker images intended to serve React-enabled
    Django pages must be built only after the frontend asset pipeline has completed.
    This ensures that all compiled React bundles and ``manifest.json`` metadata are available
    inside the container image at runtime.
* Convenience Tooling
    Smarter provides helper commands such as `make react-build` and `make react-build-ci`
    to simplify common frontend integration workflows and to keep Django’s
    static directories aligned with current React build outputs.

Collectively, these conventions provide a predictable and highly reproducible
deployment model that works consistently across local development environments,
CI/CD workflows, Docker container builds, and production infrastructure. The
result is a React integration architecture that preserves the operational
simplicity of Django deployments while still enabling modern frontend build
pipelines and advanced React development workflows.
