Developer Setup Guide
=======================

Smarter follows opinionated code style policies for most of the
technologies in this repo. With that in mind, following is how to
correctly setup your local development environment.


Prerequisites
---------------

Before attempting to
setup this project you should ensure that the following prerequisites
are installed in your local environment:

- Docker Desktop or Docker CE 25x or later
- Docker Compose
- Node: 24 or later
- python: 3.13 or later
- git: 2.x or later
- make: 3.8 or later

You should also review and execute the following script to ensure that you have
all of the necessary macOS system dependencies for building Python packages.

.. code:: console

  bash ./scripts/install-macos-python-build-deps.sh


Lastly, if you work on cloud infrastructure then you’ll also need these:

- terraform latest
- terragrunt latest
- awscli: latest

Launch the Smarter Platform
----------------------------

.. code:: console

   git clone https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter.git
   make         # scaffold a .env file in the root of the repo
                #
                # ****************************
                # STOP HERE!
                # ****************************
                # Add your credentials to .env located in the project
                # root folder.

   make init    # initialize dev environment, build & init docker.
   make build   # builds and configures all docker containers
   make run     # runs all docker containers and starts a local web server on port 8000


Work With Source Code
-------------------------

To preserve your own sanity, don’t spend time formatting your Python,
Terraform, JS or any other source code because pre-commit invokes
automatic code formatting utilities such as black, flake8 and prettier,
on all local commits, and these will reformat the code in your commit
based on policy configuration files found in the root of this repo.

Running ``docker ps`` you should see output similar to the following.

.. code:: console

   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES

   33c6673de559   redis:latest   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   6379/tcp                 smarter-redis

Good Coding Best Practices
--------------------------

This project demonstrates a wide variety of good coding best practices
for managing mission-critical cloud-based micro services in a team
environment, namely its adherence to `12-Factor
Methodology <./12-factor-app.html>`__. Please see this `Developer Guide <./developer-guidelines.html>`__
for additional details.

We want to make this project more accessible to students and learners as
an instructional tool while not adding undue code review workloads to
anyone with merge authority for the project. To this end we’ve also
added several pre-commit code linting and code style enforcement tools,
as well as automated procedures for version maintenance of package
dependencies, pull request evaluations, and semantic releases.

Repository Setup
----------------

.env setup
~~~~~~~~~~

Smarter uses a **LOT** of configuration data. You’ll find a
pre-formatted `example .env file <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/docs/example-dot-env>`__ to
help you get started, noting however that simply running ``make`` from
the root of this repo will scaffold this exact file for you.

pre-commit setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project uses pre-commit as a first-pass automated code review / QC
process. pre-commit runs a multitude of utilities and checks for code
formatting, linting, syntax checking, and ensuring that you don’t
accidentally push something to GitHub which you’d later regret. Broadly
speaking, these checks are aimed at minimizing the extent of commits
that contain various kinds of defects and stylistic imperfections that
don’t belong on the main branch of the project.

Note that many of the pre-commit commands are actually executed by
Python which in turn is calling pip-installed packages listed in
smarter/requirements/local.txt located in the root of the repo. It
therefore is important that you first create the Python virtual
environment using ``make pre-commit``. It also is a good idea to do a
complete ‘dry run’ of pre-commit, to ensure that your developer
environment is correctly setup:

.. code:: console

   make pre-commit

Output should look similar to the following:

.. figure::
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smarter-sh/smarter/main/docs/img/pre-commit.png
   :alt: pre-commit output

   pre-commit output

Github Secrets setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common secrets for automated CD/CD processes are managed with `GitHub
Secrets <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions>`__.
The GitHub Actions automated processes depend on several of these. When
creating pull requests, the GitHub Actions will use these secrets,
`github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/settings/secrets/actions <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/settings/secrets/actions>`__,
so there’s nothing special for you to do.

On the other hand, if you’ve forked this repo and are working on your
own independent project, then you’ll need to initialize each of these
yourself.

.. figure::
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smarter-sh/smarter/main/docs/img/github-secrets.png
   :alt: Github Secrets

   Github Secrets

Kubernetes Secrets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Terraform code in this repo generates several sets of sensitive data
that are persisted to `Kubernetes Secrets <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`__.
This configuration data is tightly integrated to the CI/CD build and
deploy workflows, and fully automates configuration of all back end
services on which Smarter relies including for example, MariaDB, SMTP
Email, AWS S3, AWS Elastic Container Registry, and Kubernetes itself.

GitHub Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project depends heavily on GitHub Actions to automate routine
activities, so that hopefully, the source code is always well-documented
and easy to read, and everything works perfectly. We automate the
following in this project:

- Code style and linting checks, during both pre-commit as well as
  triggered on pushes to the main branch
- Unit tests for Python, React and Terraform
- Docker builds
- Environment-specific deployments to Kubernetes
- Semantic Version releases
- version bumps from npm, PyPi and Terraform Registry

A typical pull request will look like the following:

Docker Setup
------------

You can leverage Docker Community Edition and Docker Compose to stand up
the entire Smarter platforn in your local development environment. This
closely approximates the Kubernetes production environment in which
Smarter actually runs. Everything is substantially created with two
files located in the root of this repo:

- `Dockerfile <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/Dockerfile>`__:
  This defines the contents and configuration of the Docker container
  used to deploy the Smarter application, worker, and Celery Beat
  service in all Kubernetes environments as well as in your local Docker
  CE environment. Thus, think twice before pushing modifications to this
  file, as there could be unintended consequences.
- `docker-compose.yml <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/docker-compose.yml>`__:
  This simulates the Helm deployment charts used for Kubernetes based
  staging and production environment. It defines all services that
  makeup the application stack, including MariaDB and Redis.
- `Helm Chart <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/helm/charts/smarter/>`__:
  Smarter is deployed to Kubernetes via this locally managed Helm chart.
  You can use this as a reference for questions regarding ports, network
  configuration, horizontal and vertical scaling configuration, and
  Docker Container configurations for each service.

Python Setup
------------

Smarter is built substantially on the `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ web
development framework for Python,
`Django REST Framework <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`__ and
`Pydantic <https://docs.pydantic.dev/>`__ data validation library.
Smarter strictly follows generally accepted best practices and coding
conventions for all of these. Thus, to work effectively on this project
you’ll need familiarity with all of these third party code libraries.
Also note that this project leverages
`Dependabot <https://github.com/dependabot>`__ and
`Mergify <https://mergify.com/>`__ for managing version numbers of all
Python dependencies that are used in this project. These two services
monitor all of the Python (and NPM and Terraform) dependencies for the
project, automatically bumping package versions as well as running
unit-tests in order to guard the main branch against breaking changes.
Versions should therefore always be up to date at the moment that you
clone the repo, and it should not be necessary for you to manually bump
PyPi package version numbers inside the Python requirements files.

- Python requirements:
  `smarter/requirements <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/smarter/requirements/>`__.
- Django settings:
  `smarter/smarter/settings <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/smarter/smarter/settings/>`__
- Dependabot configuration:
  `.github/dependabot.yml <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml>`__
- Mergify configuration:
  `.mergify.yml <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/.mergify.yml>`__

.. code:: console

   make django-init
   make python-lint
   source venv/bin/activate

Configuration Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Smarter generally follows Django’s convention of storing most
configuration data in environment-specific python modules that are
accessible via ``django.conf.settings``. However, in light of the fact
that Smarter uses a **LOT** of configuration data, and that this
configuration data necessarily lives in many different locations, we
also have our own propriety configuration module which is based on
`Pydantic <https://docs.pydantic.dev/>`__. The module can be found
`here <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/smarter/smarter/apps/common/conf.py>`__
and is accessed as follows:

.. code:: python

   from smarter.apps.common.conf import settings as smarter_settings

Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~

We’re using ``unittest`` combined with ``django.test`` in this project.
There’s a shortcut for running all tests: ``make django-test``. You
should create relevant unit tests for your new features, sufficient to
achieve a `Coverage <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/>`__ analysis of at
least 75%.

Coverage
~~~~~~~~

Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It
monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been
executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been
executed but was not.

Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of
tests. It can show which parts of your code are being exercised by
tests, and which are not.

Note the following shortcut for running a Coverage report:
``make coverage``.

**Our goal for this project is to maintain an overall Coverage score of
at least 80%.**

Keen Bootstrap Theme Setup
--------------------------

The Smarter dashboard UX is created with this `Bootstrap-based theme
package <https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/keen-the-ultimate-bootstrap-admin-theme/>`__
authored and maintained by `KeenThemes <https://keenthemes.com/>`__.

The complete, unmodified original set of resource files are located in
this
`keen_v3.0.6 <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/keen_v3.0.6/>`__
folder in this repo.

These assets have been fully integrated into Django’s templating system,
which means that the html has been normalized, and that other static
assets like fonts, svg, css, js and images are served from this
`static <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/smarter/smarter/static/>`__
folder.

`SASS
variables <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/keen_v3.0.6/demo1/src/sass/layout/_variables.custom.scss>`__

Note the following helper commands:

.. code:: console

   make keen-init      # locally installs npm, yarn and gulp requirements
   make keen-build     # compile Sass and javascript into css and js bundles
   make keen-server    # locally run the demo site

AWS Cloud Infrastructure
------------------------

Smarter runs on AWS cloud infrastructure. Please take note that all
Smarter cloud resources reside on a private network that is not publicly
accessible to anyone; not even admins. To access this cluster to perform
diagnostics and administrative activities you’ll need ssh access to the
Ubuntu bastion server, which is the sole publicly accessible host for
this project. The operating system, system packages, license keys, and
application software are all regularly updated, making this a convenient
1-stop shop for all your admin activities on this project.

Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~

A single, shared Kubernetes cluster hosts test, staging and production
environments. The bastion server has preconfigured kubectl cli as well
as a nice ascii gui-based application named k9s that is especially
helpful if you’re unfamiliar with the inner workings of Kubernetes.

MariaDB
~~~~~~~~

Smarter persists most of its data to MariaDB running as a pod on Kubernetes.
For simple SQL tasks the bastion server provides shortcuts for connecting to
the MariaDB service from the command line. However, you can also connect
to the service using Oracle's MySQL Workbench desktop software which
conveniently, offers a means of connecting to database hosts via a
bastion server.

Other Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can request an IAM user account in order to gain AWS console access
to other cloud resources used by this project. But please be aware that
all Smarter infrastructure is managed by Terraform meaning that – best
case scenario – any changes that you might make from the console are
assured to be overwritten at some point. Smarter leverages he following
additional AWS resources:

- Virtual Private Cloud
- Certificate Manager
- Cloudfront Content Delivery Network
- Elastic Container Registry
- Route 53 DNS management
- S3 cloud storage service
- SES SMTP email service
- EC2 compute infrastructure and load balancers
