New Feature Checklist
========================

This checklist is intended to help you, a Smarter developer contributor, ensure that
any new feature you’re working on is fully integrated into the Smarter framework
and is ready for production deployment. Smarter provides a wide range of base classes,
helper mixins, and subsystems that you must utilize to ensure your feature's
compatibility and maintainability within the Smarter ecosystem. Plus, following
these rules will save you time and improve the quality of your code.

Django Checklist
-----------------

1. Register your Django app in `smarter.settings.base.INSTALLED_APPS`.
2. Add your app's top-level urls.py to smarter/urls/.
3. Ensure that your Django models inherit from smarter.lib.django.models.
4.  Include database migrations for any new models.
5. Include serializers for all models
6. Add API views and viewsets, and ensure they cover all models
7. Add Django admin classes for all models using smarter.apps.dashboard.admin.SmarterCustomerModelAdmin
8. Add your new settings to :class:`smarter.common.conf.settings.SmarterSettings` and include sensible defaults and documentation for each setting.
9. Include a tasks module
10. Include a management commands module
11. Include signals and receivers modules.

    - :class:`smarter.lib.manifest.models.AbstractSAMBase`
    - get_cached_object() and get_cached_objects() class methods on SAM ORM models
2. Ensure that your unit test coverage ratio is at least 85% for any new code you add.
3. Include SAM models and brokers for each relevant ORM model.
4. Add new Smarter resource kinds to :class:`smarter.apps.api.v1.manifests.enum.SAMKinds`
5. Add waffle logging and feature switches as necessary to :class:`smarter.lib.django.waffle.SmarterWaffleSwitches`
6. Ensure that your UI includes anchors as necessary in :file:`smarter/templates/dashboard/authenticated.html`
7. Ensure that exceptions are properly handled and that you have inherited from :class:`smarter.common.exceptions.SmarterException`
8. Add your feature's JSON schema view to smarter.apps.docs.views.json_schema and register it in smarter.apps.docs.urls
9. Add your feature's example manifest view to smarter.apps.docs.views.manifest and register it in smarter.apps.docs.urls
10. Add your feature's Broker to smarter.apps.api.v1.cli.brokers.Brokers
