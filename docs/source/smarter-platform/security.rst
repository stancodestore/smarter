Security
========

Security is a critical aspect of system management. This section covers best practices, tools, and techniques to ensure the security of your systems.

Firewall
---------

**Smarter does not provide a built-in firewall solution.** However, many of the items that follow are directly or indirectly related to firewall configuration and management,
including for example, limitations on hosts and remote access, ports, ingress design, DNS configuration, and so forth.

The Smarter project production environment is designed to be installed on an **existing** AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
AWS VPC provides robust firewall capabilities that allow you to control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances.
It is recommended to configure security groups and network ACLs to restrict access to only necessary ports and IP addresses.

Please note the following recommendations for a network design that we would consider secure:

- **Use private subnets** for instances that do not require direct internet access. Namely, database server, and compute.
- **Use public subnets** only for instances that require direct internet access, such as web servers or bastion hosts.
- **Implement AWS security groups** to control traffic at the instance level.
- **Limit inbound traffic** to only necessary ports (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SSH) and trusted IP addresses. SSH (port 22) access should be restricted to known IP addresses only.

Application Security
---------------------

Smarter implements the following application security measures:

Proprietary Security Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **No DNS Wildcards**. Prevents wildcard DNS entries to avoid subdomain takeover attacks. Smarter maintains strict DNS records for each deployed LLMClient/Agent using AWS Route53 Hosted Zones. Kubernetes Ingress resources are configured to only respond to specific domain names associated with each LLMClient/Agent, and Kubernetes cert-manager manages dedicated TLS certificates for these domains. This ensures that requests to undefined subdomains are not inadvertently routed to the application, thereby mitigating the risk of subdomain takeover attacks.

- **Security Headers** (e.g., X-Frame-Options via middleware). See `Security Middleware <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/security/#security-middlewares>`_


Secure Remote Access
---------------------

Smarter is designed as an API-first application, even though it also includes a web-based
Prompt Engineer Workbench and Django Admin interface. This affords the Smarter platform the
luxury of minimizing its attack surface primarily to http and https traffic only, and at that,
to a limited set of URL endpoints.

If you follow Smarter's recommended deployment architecture on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS),
you can further limit remote access to the Smarter platform in that this will/can prevent remote
ssh access to the underlying host instances altogether. Instead, all remote access to the Smarter
platform is performed securely over https using strong authentication mechanisms such as OAuth2
and Smarter's token-based authentication for API access.

Additionally, a Kubernetes-based deployment will lead to all domain traffic being routed through
a secure AWS Classic Load Balancer (ALB) which can be further configured via Kubernetes Nginx Ingress Controller
to provide additional layers of security such as Web Application Firewall (WAF), DDoS protection, SSL/TLS termination,
and more. AWS Load balancers inherently behave as reverse proxies / firewalls, in that they
only allow traffic to reach the underlying host instances on specific ports (e.g., 80, 443)
and only for specific domain names. Think of this as a "belt & suspenders" additional layer of firewall protection.

*Less is more. Simpler is better.*

Smarter Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Smarter implements a proprietary token-based authentication mechanism for its API endpoints
which is based on Django knox. This enables enhanced Journal support as well as log warnings
for API keys that have exceeded their maximum lifetime.
See `smarter/lib/drf/token_authentication.py <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/smarter/smarter/lib/drf/token_authentication.py>`_ and `smarter/lib/drf/middleware.py <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter/blob/main/smarter/smarter/lib/drf/middleware.py>`_ for details.


Audit Logging
----------------

See `Smarter Journal <smarter-journal.html>`_ for details on logging security-related events.
See `Configuration Management <configuration.html>`_ for details on logging configuration changes.

Malware Protection
------------------

Smarter does not provide built-in malware protection.


User management
---------------

See `User Management <user-management.html>`_ for details on managing user access and permissions.


Data Encryption
----------------

Smarter does not provide built-in data encryption features.


Security Updates
----------------

Smarter is a Docker-based application that follows best practices for applying security updates to its
dependencies and underlying systems. It is recommended to regularly update the Docker images and dependencies used by
deploying the Smarter DockerHub 'latest' image, which includes the latest security patches and updates. The
DockerHub images are regularly maintained -- typically at least once per month -- to ensure they
include the latest security fixes.

See `Installation <installation.html>`_ for further details.
