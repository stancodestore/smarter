Quick Start Guide
===================================

You'll be up and running on your desktop in about 10 minutes!

1. Install Docker Desktop.
-------------------------------

If you haven't already, download and install `Docker Desktop <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/>`__. This will also install Docker Compose.

2. Clone the Repository.
-------------------------------

Open your terminal (command prompt) and run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-deploy.git
   cd smarter-deploy


3. Prepare Your Environment File.
-----------------------------------

Smarter requires a .env file with your credentials and configuration. You can scaffold a template using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   make                # creates a .env file in the root of the repo

.. important::

   Open the newly created .env file and add your credentials (API keys, passwords, etc.) as needed. The application will not run without this step.
   Note that `.env` contains copious inline documentation that you can refer to for specific configuration and technical guidance.

        alt="Smarter Login Screen"/>


4. Initialize the Application.
-------------------------------

This step pulls the Docker containers, and seeds the platform with test data:

.. code-block:: console

  make init


5. Start the Application.
-------------------------------

Run the following command to start all Docker containers and launch the web server:

.. code-block:: console

  make run

The web console will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:9357/ or http://localhost:9357
If you see a login screen, your deployment is working!

        alt="Smarter Login Screen"/>



6. Log In.
-------------------------------

Go to http://localhost:9357/login/ and log in with:

Username: admin@smarter.sh
Password: smarter

.. attention::
   For security reasons, be sure to change the default password after your first login.

7. Download the Smarter Command-Line Interface.
---------------------------------------------------

You'll need to download, install and configure the cli in order to manage AI resources. Get the cli here: `smarter.sh/cli <https://smarter.sh/cli>`__.
