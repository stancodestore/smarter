How-To: Adding an LLM Provider to Smarter
==========================================

Goal
====

Register an LLM provider with Smarter so its models are available for use
in llm_clients and the Workbench.

Supported Providers
===================

Smarter supports two categories of LLM providers.

**Built-in providers** are pre-initialized automatically during deployment.
You only need to supply the API key in ``.env``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40 40

   * - Provider
     - Environment Variable
     - API Key Console
   * - OpenAI *(required)*
     - ``SMARTER_OPENAI_API_KEY``
     - `platform.openai.com/api-keys <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>`_
   * - GoogleAI
     - ``SMARTER_GEMINI_API_KEY``
     - `aistudio.google.com/app/apikey <https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>`_
   * - MetaAI
     - ``SMARTER_LLAMA_API_KEY``
     - `console.apillm.com <https://console.apillm.com/en/dashboard/api-token>`_

**Additional providers** require both an API key in ``.env`` **and** a
Provider manifest applied via the CLI:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40 40

   * - Provider
     - Environment Variable
     - API Key Console
   * - Anthropic
     - ``SMARTER_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``
     - `console.anthropic.com <https://console.anthropic.com/>`_
   * - Cohere
     - ``SMARTER_COHERE_API_KEY``
     - `dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys <https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys>`_
   * - Fireworks
     - ``SMARTER_FIREWORKS_API_KEY``
     - `fireworks.ai/api-keys <https://fireworks.ai/api-keys/>`_
   * - Mistral
     - ``SMARTER_MISTRAL_API_KEY``
     - `console.mistral.ai/api-keys <https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/>`_
   * - TogetherAI
     - ``SMARTER_TOGETHERAI_API_KEY``
     - `together.ai/settings/api-keys <https://together.ai/settings/api-keys>`_

Prerequisites
=============

- Smarter v0.11.0 or later, running and accessible.
- Administrator-level account with access to the web console.
- Smarter CLI installed. See :doc:`/smarter-framework/smarter-cli`.
- A text editor. VS Code with the
  `Smarter YAML extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=querium.smarter-manifest>`_
  is recommended.

Setup
=====

The following walkthrough uses **Anthropic** as the example. The same
steps apply to any additional provider — substitute the appropriate
environment variable and provider name from the table above.

Step 1: Get an API Key
-----------------------

For Anthropic:

1. Sign in at `https://console.anthropic.com/ <https://console.anthropic.com/>`_.
2. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys → Create Key**.

   :alt: Anthropic Console API Keys

   Anthropic Console API Keys

3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g. ``smarter-napl-prod``) and copy the value
   immediately — it will not be shown again.

.. danger::

   Never commit API keys to version control.

Step 2: Add the Key to Smarter
--------------------------------

Open the ``.env`` file at the root of your Smarter deployment and add:

.. code-block:: bash

   SMARTER_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Restart the application to load the new credential:

.. code-block:: bash

   make restart

Concept Overview
================

Smarter manages every resource — providers, llm_clients, plugins — the same way:
a YAML manifest you write and apply via the CLI. This pattern is deliberately
modeled on Kubernetes. These files are called **SAM** (Smarter API Manifests).

A Provider manifest has four sections:

- ``apiVersion``: Always ``smarter.sh/v1``.
- ``kind``: Set to ``Provider``.
- ``metadata``: Name, description, and version of this resource.
- ``spec``: The provider configuration — which backend, which model.

When you apply the manifest, Smarter registers the provider and immediately
runs verification: it calls the provider's API, confirms the model is
reachable, and marks the provider active.

.. note::

   Built-in providers (OpenAI, GoogleAI, MetaAI) are registered automatically
   during deployment and do not require a manifest — only their ``SMARTER_*``
   environment variable.

Step-by-Step: Create and Apply a Provider Manifest
===================================================

Step 3: Generate a Starting Template
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   smarter manifest provider

This prints a valid example manifest. Use it as a reference while writing
your own.

Step 4: Write the Provider Manifests
--------------------------------------

Create one manifest per model. This example registers both Claude Opus and
Claude Sonnet so you can compare their responses side-by-side in the
Workbench.

``anthropic-opus.yaml`` — higher capability, best for complex reasoning:

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: smarter.sh/v1
   kind: Provider
   metadata:
     name: anthropic-opus
     description: Anthropic Claude Opus 4 — high-capability model for NAPL
     version: 1.0.0
   spec:
     provider:
       name: anthropic
       model: claude-opus-4-5

``anthropic-sonnet.yaml`` — faster and more cost-efficient:

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: smarter.sh/v1
   kind: Provider
   metadata:
     name: anthropic-sonnet
     description: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 — balanced speed and quality for NAPL
     version: 1.0.0
   spec:
     provider:
       name: anthropic
       model: claude-sonnet-4-6

.. note::

   Model identifiers are case-sensitive and must match the provider's published
   names exactly. For the full ``spec`` field reference, see
   :doc:`/smarter-resources/provider/manifest`.

Step 5: Apply Both Manifests
------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   smarter apply -f anthropic-opus.yaml
   smarter apply -f anthropic-sonnet.yaml

Smarter registers each provider and begins verification checks automatically.

Step 6: Confirm Both Providers are Active
------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   smarter describe provider anthropic-opus
   smarter describe provider anthropic-sonnet

Look for a ``status`` section in each output showing that verification has
passed. If it shows ``pending``, wait 30 seconds and run the command again —
the verification checks are asynchronous.

You can also confirm in the web console: **Providers** in the left sidebar
should list both ``anthropic-opus`` and ``anthropic-sonnet`` with active status.

.. tip::

   With both providers registered, you can create two llm_clients — one backed
   by each model — and compare their responses to the same prompt in the
   Workbench. This is a practical way to evaluate cost vs. quality trade-offs
   before committing to a model for production.

Proof of Concept
================

Run:

.. code-block:: bash

   smarter describe provider anthropic-opus
   smarter describe provider anthropic-sonnet

Both outputs should include a ``status`` block with ``verified: true``. That
means Smarter has confirmed a live connection to the provider API and both
models are ready to use.

Expected output for each provider:

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: smarter.sh/v1
   kind: Provider
   metadata:
     name: anthropic-opus
     description: Anthropic Claude Opus 4 — high-capability model for NAPL
     version: 1.0.0
   spec:
     provider:
       name: anthropic
       model: claude-opus-4-5
   status:
     verified: true
     active: true
     last_verified: "2026-03-31T00:00:00Z"

Troubleshooting
===============

**Startup error: "API key not found"**
   The ``SMARTER_*_API_KEY`` variable is missing from ``.env`` or the
   application has not been restarted. Run ``make restart``.

**Provider status: "verification failed"**
   The API key is invalid or has been revoked. Generate a new key at the
   provider's console and update ``.env``.

**Apply error: "Model not found"**
   The ``model`` value in your manifest does not match the provider's published
   identifier. Model identifiers are case-sensitive.

**Manifest validation errors**
   YAML indentation is almost always the cause. Run ``smarter manifest provider``
   to compare your file against a known-good template.
