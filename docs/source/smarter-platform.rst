Platform Administration Guide
===============================

The Smarter platform is a batteries-included solution
that is designed to provide large organizations with a robust and scalable foundation
for deploying and managing :doc:`AI applications <smarter-resources>` in production environments.

Smarter runs natively on :doc:`Kubernetes <smarter-framework/technologies/kubernetes>` in
the cloud at :doc:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <smarter-framework/technologies/aws>`.
It provides the necessary :doc:`infrastructure <smarter-platform/cloud-infrastructure>` and services to host and manage
:doc:`AI-driven workflows, agents and llm_clients <smarter-resources/smarter-llm_client>` that
are :doc:`securely integrated <smarter-resources/smarter-plugin>` to
enterprise data sources and systems.

The Smarter platform's fundamental building blocks to this extent are:

- This documentation. See `Smarter Documentation <https://docs.smarter.sh/>`__
- Managed Docker containers. See `Smarter on DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/mcdaniel0073/smarter>`__
- Managed Helm charts. See `Smarter Helm Chart <https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/project-smarter/smarter>`__
- Managed cloud infrastructure. See `Smarter Terraforms <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-infrastructure>`__
- Broad support for our developer ecosystem. See `Smarter Developer Resources <https://smarter.sh/>`__
